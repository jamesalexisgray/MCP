Create a web app using the
- Azure Portal
- Azure Command Line Interface (CLI)
- A Script
- An integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio

Can use a deployment slots for example create a staging deployment slot to push code to test in Azure and when happy swap the staging deployment slot with the production slot

Has out of the box continuous integration and deployment with Azure Repos, GetHub, Bitbucket, FTP or a local Git repository on your local machine. The App Service can authomatically sunc your code and future changes into the web app

Azure Reopos, you can define and build your own release process, that compiles source code, runs tests, builds a release and deploys into the web app every time the code is committed without need for intervention (continuous integration/deployment)

Scale up/down is built into web apps based on usage, as in scal up/down by increasing/decreasing the resources of the underlying machine hosting the web app

Scale out/in is the ability to increase the number of machine instances running in the web app

Can publish your app to App Service as code, or as a ready-to-run Docker Container (select container in the wizard, and provide detail about the Docker registry from whhich the App Service will retrieve the image)

App Service needs to know the runtime stack e,g Node.js, Python, Java, .NET

App Service can host applications on Windows or Linux Servers

An App service plan is a set of virtual server resrouces that run App Service apps, also called SKU or pricing tier
